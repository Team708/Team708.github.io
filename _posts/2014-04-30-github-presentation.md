Hello once again everyone! Last year, we attempted to use Github to manage our software team. While in theory, this sounds like a perfectly sound idea,
we had the issue of only the head programmer knowing how to use Git. This year, we had slightly more success with the discovery of Github for Windows.
Having a graphical interface to see what is one is trying to do greatly helped out everyone. There was still a bit of a learning curve that needed to be
worked on.

My solution to this was creating a PowerPoint presentation for next year, and it can be downloaded [here](http://team708.github.io/downloads/github_708.pptx). It covers the basics
of using both the GUI and how to do the same thing in the Git shell, as well as some things that I have yet to figure out if it is possible in the GUI.

I am open to anything that needs to be added to it, just comment below or email me.
