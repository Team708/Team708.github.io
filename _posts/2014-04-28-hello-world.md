Hello all, and if you are reading this, then I did not break the code! My name is Nam Tran, and I am the head control systems person for the 2015 FRC season.
In an attempt to better communicate with others on the team in regards to what is going on, as well as give me something to do when I have free time, I have
started this website for Team 708's control systems team.

As of right now, there won't be much going on, but during our summer off-season, I intend to create a few presentations and tutorials to help out any of the 
incoming freshmen on our team, as well as keep a blog of any software developments for our various projects.

Until then, I am off to do homework that has been stacking from our trip to the FIRST World Championships...
